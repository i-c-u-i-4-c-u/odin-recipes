    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that consists of layers of flat pasta sheets,
         sauce, cheese, and various fillings. The traditional version 
         of lasagna typically includes a tomato-based meat sauce, 
         such as Bolognese, made with ground beef, onions, garlic, and 
         herbs. </p>
