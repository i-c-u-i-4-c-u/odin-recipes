    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried rice is a popular dish that originated in China but is now enjoyed in various cuisines
         around the world. It is made by stir-frying cooked rice with a 
        combination of vegetables, proteins (such as meat, seafood, or tofu), and seasonings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Cooked rice (preferably a day old and chilled)</li>
            <li>Vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, bell peppers, onions, corn, etc.)</li>
           <li>Proteins (e.g., diced chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu, etc.)</li>
           <li>Aromatics (e.g., minced garlic, grated ginger, etc.)</li>
            <li>Eggs (optional)</li>
           <li>Soy sauce or other seasonings (e.g., oyster sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, etc.)</li>
           <li>Cooking oil (e.g., vegetable oil, peanut oil, etc.)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add some cooking oil and allow it to heat up.</li>
        <li>If using eggs, you can scramble them in the pan first. Push the cooked eggs to one side of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the aromatics, such as minced garlic and grated ginger, to the hot oil and saut√© them briefly until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of vegetables and proteins to the pan. Stir-fry them until they are cooked through and tender. It's common to cook proteins first and set them aside before adding them back to the pan later.</li>
        <li>Push the vegetables and proteins to one side of the pan, creating a space in the center. Add a little more oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the chilled cooked rice to the center of the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry the rice with the other ingredients, ensuring it is evenly coated with the oil and evenly heated.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the vegetables, proteins, and rice together in the pan. Stir-fry everything together for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
        <li>Season the fried rice with soy sauce or other preferred seasonings, adjusting the amount to taste. Be cautious with salt if using soy sauce, as it is already salty.</li>
        <li>Continue to stir-fry for a few more minutes, ensuring the rice is heated through and well combined with the flavors.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and serve the fried rice hot.
